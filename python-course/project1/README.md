### Phone Directory Project  

By the end of this project, will be able to:  
- Understand how functions work.  
- Work with dictionaries.  
- Use loops with dictionaries.  
- Combine loops and if statements effectively.  

#### Requirements  
Build a program that represents a phone directory. The program should accept a phone number and return the name of the person associated with it. Use the following table as a reference:  

| Name       | Number      |  
|------------|-------------|  
| Amal       | 1111111111  |  
| Mohammed   | 2222222222  |  
| Khadijah   | 3333333333  |  
| Abdullah   | 4444444444  |  
| Rawan      | 5555555555  |  
| Faisal     | 6666666666  |  
| Layla      | 7777777777  |  

If the entered number exists in the directory, the program will print the name of the owner. If the number does not exist, it will display the message:  
**"Sorry, the number is not found"**

If the input is less than or more than 10 digits, or includes non-numeric characters (e.g., letters, symbols, logical values), it will print:  
**"This is an invalid number"**
