Birthday Calculation Project

By the end of this project, will be able to:

* Work with dates.
* Handle numbers.
* Utilize advanced data types (Sequences) and their methods.
* Dive deeper into functions.

The program should calculate the current age for each person based on the input birthdate.
Determine the day of the week the person was born.
